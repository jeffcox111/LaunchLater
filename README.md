# LaunchLater

A Windows application that allows for deferred automatic startup of applications at boot.

Latest Release: https://github.com/jeffcox111/LaunchLater/releases/tag/v2.4

LaunchLater allows you to defer the launch of applications that run at Windows login. This lets Windows focus on booting itself first, then subsequently running a list of configured startup apps using a schedule that you control.  Sometimes, procrastination really does pay off!
 
LaunchLater is written with C# 4.0, using .Net Framework 4.0 and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
