<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Installation is a snap- simply download and run the installer of the latest version of LaunchLater by clicking on the Downloads tab on the Codeplex page.&nbsp; The installer works just like any other Windows installer you&rsquo;ve ever used; you&rsquo;ll
 be fine, I promise.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from a previous version of LaunchLater, the new installer will overwrite the old version and automatically import your previous configuration.&nbsp; No need to back-up or manually re-enter your existing list of startup apps.</p>
<p>If for some reason you are unable to install LaunchLater with the current version&rsquo;s installer, PLEASE notify me by posting in the Discussions section of the Codeplex page!&nbsp; Doing so would be an enormous help to me and to future users of the software!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Configuration and Usage</h1>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got LaunchLater installed, it will be time to put it to work!</p>
<p>LaunchLater consists of two separate pieces, the configuration manager, and the LaunchPad.&nbsp; The configuration manager is where you will customize your startup apps and determine how long after Windows boot up you want them to begin.&nbsp; You can set
 arguments to be passed to the apps here, as well as disable certain apps from automatically starting altogether.&nbsp; The LaunchPad is the piece you will see running on your system tray every time you reboot your Windows computer from now on.&nbsp; It will
 notify you as to which application is starting up, as well as let you pause, resume, cancel, or preemptively execute any application that you&rsquo;ve configured in LaunchLater.</p>
<p>To get started, the first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is open up the configuration manager.&nbsp; It will be located in the LaunchLater folder on your Start Menu.&nbsp; When you run it for the very first time, you&rsquo;ll see that the Windows Calculator
 is already configured there.&nbsp; You probably don&rsquo;t want the calculator to start automatically with Windows, unless perhaps you&rsquo;re a bigger nerd than I am, but I wanted you to see this app first to get an idea of how apps are configured.&nbsp;
 Feel free to play around with its settings by clicking on the Edit button.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re ready, go ahead and delete the Calculator example and start importing your own start up apps.&nbsp; I recommend clicking the &ldquo;Import Startup Items&rdquo; button.&nbsp; This will search your computer for existing startup apps that
 LaunchLater will recommend taking over for you.&nbsp; Carefully read this list and be sure not to checkmark security applications or virus scanners.&nbsp; LaunchLater will allow you to schedule those items, but it is definitely not a best practice.&nbsp; When
 you&rsquo;re done check-marking all the apps you&rsquo;d like to import, just click the &ldquo;Import&rdquo; button at the bottom of this window.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see all of your apps brought into the configuration manager.</p>
<p>If there are any other apps that don&rsquo;t automatically start with Windows, feel free to add those too using the &ldquo;Add App&rdquo; button.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll simply browse to the .exe file that you want to add to your startup configuration and click
 Okay.</p>
<p>Once you have the list of apps that you want to automatically launch with Windows, edit each one of them to set the amount of minutes and seconds you&rsquo;d like each of them to delay.&nbsp; Take into consideration how soon you think you may need access
 to a given app.&nbsp; Also think about how much time it takes for that app to launch- I personally save the slower-to-start apps for later when possible, so that they stay out of the way while my smaller apps start first.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re finished, close the configuration manager, being sure to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when asked if you&rsquo;d like to save changes.&nbsp; Now then, reboot your computer and see how much faster you get to your Windows desktop!</p>
<p>It is perfectly normal to observe the boot process and decide to fine tune your LaunchLater configuration.&nbsp; You might go through a few revisions of your schedule before you get your boot process tuned specifically to your needs, and that&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;
 What&rsquo;s important is that you&rsquo;ve just spent a few minutes that you will earn back quickly each time your computer starts up.&nbsp; Your hard drive will also thank you, since it won&rsquo;t be getting thrashed quite so severely during startup.</p>
<p>But what if you really want one of your scheduled apps to start &ldquo;<em>right now!&rdquo;</em>?&nbsp; Easy- simply right-click on the LauchPad&rsquo;s icon on your system tray, select your desired app, and click the Execute button on the popup menu.&nbsp;
 Similarly, you can pause/resume and cancel any of your apps individually, or all of them at the same time.&nbsp; Once the LaunchPad has finished starting all your apps for you, it will close down to free memory back up to the operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions or issues with LaunchLater, please read the FAQ below.&nbsp; If your needs still aren&rsquo;t met, let me quickly apologize for the inconvenience, and allow me to refer you to the
<a href="http://launchlater.codeplex.com/discussions">Discussions</a> tab on the Codeplex page.&nbsp; Please feel free to add any questions, concerns, or remarks here and I will do my best to address them.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving LaunchLater a try!&nbsp; As with all open source software, please feel free to use it, change it, improve it, share it, publish it, or even hate it.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>Q: &ldquo;I hate your stupid software so I uninstalled it! Now where are my startup apps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s easy- they are right where you left them, but now there isn&rsquo;t anything telling them to start up.&nbsp; The easiest solution to this problem is to reinstall the latest version of LaunchLater.&nbsp; Then go into the configuration
 manager and delete each app that you want returned to normal startup.&nbsp; When deleting each app, you will be asked if you&rsquo;d like for it to be returned to its original configuration.&nbsp; Click &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and then save your changes when you
 close the configuration manager.&nbsp; Uninstall LaunchLater again and your apps will be started automatically by Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp; &ldquo;I scheduled this one app to run 5 minutes after startup, but sometimes I need it immediately! Do I always have to wait 5 minutes for it to load?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to wait!&nbsp; Sometimes, you really do need your apps to LaunchSooner!&nbsp; Simply right-click on the LaunchLater icon on your system tray, then mouse over the app you would like to launch immediately.&nbsp; Use
 the context menu that flies out and click &lsquo;Execute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the LaunchLater app in my system tray when my computer boots up.&nbsp; How am I supposed to right-click on it and interact with the schedule of apps as they are loading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; This is likely because the LaunchLater app is configured to be hidden by default in your Windows configuration.&nbsp; Click on the little up arrow to the left of your system tray and click &lsquo;Customize&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; This window will allow
 you to configure which apps are allowed to show their notifications and icons.&nbsp; Find the LL_LaunchPad app and be sure it is set to &lsquo;Show icon and notifications.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &quot;I configured an app to run with LaunchLater, but it is still starting up immediately when Windows starts! Why??&quot;</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Some applications have their own internal settings that allow them to control when they start up. &nbsp;Dropbox, one of my personal favorite apps, is like this. &nbsp;You have to enter the settings for that application and tell it explicitly NOT
 to automatically start with Windows. &nbsp;Once you've set this, LaunchLater will run it when you want just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: &ldquo;LaunchLater did something weird!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like/understand/approve-of/appreciate this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; Then tell me about it- in as much detail as you can!&nbsp; Use the Discussions tab on the Codeplex page here.&nbsp; Be verbose!</p>
